<h1><strong>Movie Rating System - Auto Encoders-<strong></h1>
<p>Our Deep learning  model Predicts the rating of the user based on the previous ratings from 1 to 5.<p>
<p>I have used auto Encoders to predict the ratings of the one particular user using auto encoders. In my previous Movie Recommended system
I predicted the movie which is liked by the particular user based on his previous data using Restricted Boltzmann Machines. Now we are prediicting the rating of a movie from
one particular user for one particular movie using auto encoders where we will try to get same output like as input via stacked auto encoders. I have acheived the loss of 0.95 where I will
I have used the dataset from 100k ratings. I will keep the 1M dataset ratings and I will encourage other developers to use there GPU's and get better
results by pulling the request. Please feel free to modify the code for improvement of the model.</p>
